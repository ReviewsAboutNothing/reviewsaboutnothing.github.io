    <h3 class="textaligncenter">Chappell Roan</h3>
    <p class="textaligncenter essays">Chappell Roan has suddenly risen to popularity, so why don’t we talk about her
        famous debut album?
        <br> <br>
        The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess is a pop album that varies between high energy anthems, and heartfelt
        ballads. It highlights themes of passion, such as in ‘Naked In Manhattan’, being part of the LGBTQ+ community,
        like in ‘Pink Pony Club’ and the struggles of love, such as in ‘Coffee’
        <br> <br>
        ‘Red Wine Supernova’ is one of the best songs on the album. Its toned down, but catchy chorus contrasts the fast
        and energetic verses and bridge, which is great sonically.
        <br> <br>
        However, ‘Picture You’ is one of the songs which doesn’t fit as well, due to it being in the middle of a
        three-track-long decrease in energy. Unfortunately, it sounds too weary which sticks out from the rest of the
        album.
        <br> <br>
        Chappell is a great lyricist, as she constantly uses symbolic metaphors to describe her passion for her lover.
        This is largely seen in the song ‘Kaleidoscope’, where she compares love to a kaleidoscope’s shapes and colours.
        <br> <br>
        I would heavily recommend this album for many. This is for its honest storytelling, especially in the ballads,
        and danceable production, especially in the anthems.
