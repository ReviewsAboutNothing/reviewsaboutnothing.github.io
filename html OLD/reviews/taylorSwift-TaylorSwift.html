    <h3 class="textaligncenter">Taylor Swift</h3>
    <p class="textaligncenter essays">Taylor Swift is a worldwide phenomenon today, so why don’t we see where it all
        began?
        <br> <br>
        Taylor Swift’s self-titled album is a country album, unlike her modern synth-pop we are used to now. It focuses
        on themes of teenage love, like in ‘Our Song’, infidelity, like in ‘Should’ve Said No’, and lack of belonging,
        like in ‘A Place In This World’.
        <br><br>
        ‘Mary’s Song (Oh My My My)’ is a standout on the album, for its narrative of the life of two young lovers. It is
        a welcome optimistic outlook on love.
        <br><br>
        On the other hand, ‘A Perfectly Good Heart’ is a low-point on the album, which is disappointing, as it is the
        last original track on the deluxe album. The generic country-pop production along with over-repetitive lyrics
        doesn’t work as well as the rest of the album.
        <br><br>
        This album’s strong point is Taylor’s teenage perspective on love. She romanticises her life using heart-warming
        lyricism and charming vocals.
        <br><br>
        I would recommend this album, especially for the sincere lyrics and simple outlook on all. It is a wholesome
        listen that can easily be listened to on the surface level, which makes it ideal for many listeners.
